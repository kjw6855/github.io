I am a fourth year Ph.D. candidate in [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/).
I work in [PurSec Lab](https://pursec.cs.purdue.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Dave (Jing) Tian](https://davejingtian.org/).
My research interests lie in the field of computer and network security.
In particular, I am interested in secure architectures for future networks and systems, including cloud networking, software-defined networking (SDN), intent-based networking (IBN), and programmable networking with P4.
Before joining Purdue, I worked in the industry for almost 4 years as a research engineer to design and develop SDN and cloud networking products.
